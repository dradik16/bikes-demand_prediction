# bikes-demand_prediction

The mission is to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather, e.g.:
“Given the forecasted weather conditions, how many bicycles can we expect to be rented out (city-wide) this Saturday at 2pm?”
After an exploratory data analysis was conducted, the data is splitted into a training and test set
Random forest regression model was used to make predictions. The predictions were succesfull with a high score of 0.5 was achieved on Kaggle with verification of the predicted results vs. actual hidden data.
